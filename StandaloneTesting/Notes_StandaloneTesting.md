* [SmithManoeuver.R](https://github.com/florentchandelier/WealthManagement/blob/master/StandaloneTesting/SmithManoeuver.R) -- implementation of the Smith Maneuver with Guerilla Capitalization. Given an initial **nondeductible 
home mortgage**, how many $$ from the principal mortgage could be funneled in a **deductible investment portfolio** benefiting from a re-advanceable mortgage structure (the Smith part), leveraging part of the principal component 
to support the portfolio interests (the Guerilla part) without re-injection of new cash flow.

> LIMITATION(s): (1) days in mth are fixed to 30, (2) re-investment of the portfolio's performance are not considered (no reinjection to repay mortgage faster ... thus readvancing/funneling faster as well), (3) 100% of what 
can be funneled without reinjecting cash is performed.
